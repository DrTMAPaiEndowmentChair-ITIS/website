## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing and implementing a threat testing recommendation engine that leverages modern AI tooling, web querying in an isolated environment, and a sophisticated shared knowledge database to provide actionable recommendations for a cybersecurity team.

The engine aims to provide insights into potential threats, vulnerabilities, and attack vectors by analyzing web-based data and integrating it with a shared knowledge base. By utilizing AI tools, the engine can offer a holistic view of the threat landscape and suggest proactive measures to mitigate risks.

Web querying in an isolated environment ensures that data collection is secure and does not expose the system to potential threats. The sophisticated shared knowledge database aggregates information from various sources, providing a comprehensive repository of threat intelligence. AI tooling enhances the engine's capabilities by analyzing patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data, allowing for more accurate and timely recommendations.

The integration of these technologies allows for the creation of a sophisticated system that can accurately identify and present potential threats. This project aims to develop a tool that automates the threat analysis process, ensuring that users can easily retrieve specific data with high accuracy and efficiency.

By leveraging modern AI tooling, web querying in an isolated environment, and a sophisticated shared knowledge database, this system will enable users to interact with threat intelligence in a natural and intuitive manner, significantly enhancing cybersecurity management and threat mitigation capabilities.
