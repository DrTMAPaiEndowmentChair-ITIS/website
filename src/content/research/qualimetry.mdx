## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing and implementing an AI-powered Qualimetry tool that leverages advanced AI tools, API integrations, dynamically generated graphing tools, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), browser control tooling, and scrapers to generate comprehensive statistics for various codebases.

The tool aims to provide insights into code quality, vulnerabilities, bugs, test coverage, and binary analysis. By integrating these modern technologies, the tool can offer a holistic view of the codebase's health and performance.

API integrations allow for seamless communication with various development tools and platforms, ensuring up-to-date data and compatibility. Dynamically generated graphing tools provide visual representations of code metrics, making it easier to identify trends and areas for improvement. VLMs extend the tool's capabilities by integrating visual data, allowing for more comprehensive analysis of code documentation and comments. Browser control tooling enables automated testing and analysis of web-based applications, while scrapers gather data from various sources, ensuring a complete and accurate assessment of the codebase.

The integration of these technologies allows for the creation of a sophisticated system that can accurately extract and present information from various codebases. This project aims to develop a tool that automates the analysis process, ensuring that users can easily retrieve specific data with high accuracy and efficiency.

By leveraging modern AI tools, API integrations, dynamically generated graphing tools, VLMs, browser control tooling, and scrapers, this system will enable users to interact with codebases in a natural and intuitive manner, significantly enhancing code quality management and information retrieval capabilities.
