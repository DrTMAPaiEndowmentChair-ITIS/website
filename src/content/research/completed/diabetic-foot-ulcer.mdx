## Project Overview

This project involved the design and development of a sensor-based insole for the early detection of abnormal plantar pressure distribution in individuals with diabetes (experiencing peripheral neuropathy), aiming to predict and prevent foot ulceration. It was funded by the BIRAC BIG Scheme 07, Government of India.

### Funding Details
- **Funding Agency**: BIRAC BIG Scheme 07, Government of India
- **Duration**: 2016-2018
- **Amount**: Rs. 49.7 Lakhs

### Research Team
- Dr. Manohara Pai M.M, Project Co-ordinator, Professor, Dept. of ICT, MIT, Manipal
- Dr. Arun Maiya, Professor, Department of Physiotherapy, SOAHS
- Dr. Radhika M Pai, Professor, Dept. of ICT, MIT, Manipal
- Dr. Sucheta V. Kolekar, Assistant Professor â€“ Sl.Grade, Dept. of I & CT, MIT, Manipal

## Technology Implementation

This innovative project combined multiple technologies:

- **Pressure-Sensitive Sensors** for plantar pressure mapping
- **Wearable Technology** for continuous monitoring
- **Mobile App Interface** for patient and physician alerts
- **Machine Learning Algorithms** for abnormality detection and prediction

### Clinical Significance

The implementation of this system offered significant medical benefits:

| Feature | Benefit |
|:--------|:--------|
| Early Detection | Identifies pressure abnormalities before visible symptoms |
| Real-time Monitoring | Continuous assessment during daily activities |
| Predictive Analytics | Anticipates ulceration risks based on pressure patterns |
| Preventive Intervention | Enables timely medical intervention |
| User-Friendly Design | Promotes consistent patient usage |

## Healthcare Impact

This project addresses a critical healthcare challenge:
- Diabetic foot ulcers affect approximately 15% of diabetic patients
- 85% of diabetes-related amputations are preceded by foot ulcers
- Early detection can reduce amputation rates by up to 85%

The successful development of this technology demonstrates the potential for innovative medical devices to significantly improve patient outcomes and quality of life for diabetic patients worldwide.
