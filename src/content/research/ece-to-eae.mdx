## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing and implementing sustainable energy solutions, including advancements in solar panel efficiency and smart grid management using IoT.

IEC 61131 is an international standard that defines PLC programming languages, including Ladder Diagram
(LD), Structured Text (ST), Function Block Diagram (FBD), Sequential Function Chart (SFC), and Instruction
List (IL). It has been the foundation for traditional industrial control systems, enabling deterministic, cyclic
execution of automation tasks.
IEC 61499, on the other hand, is a standard for distributed control systems that extends IEC 61131 by
introducing event-driven execution and hardware-independent automation models. This makes it scalable,
flexible, and modular, allowing the development of distributed automation applications that operate
independently of underlying hardware constraints.
Since most automation programs in existing industries are based on IEC 61131, migrating to IEC 61499 is
essential for enabling modular, distributed control with real-time responsiveness. However, manually
converting function blocks from IEC 61131 to IEC 61499 is a complex and error-prone process.
This project focuses on the automated conversion of function blocks from EcoStruxure Control Expert (ECE,
IEC 61131-3) to EcoStruxure Automation Expert (EAE, IEC 61499). The aim is to develop a tool that automates
this migration, ensuring that control logic remains functionally correct and adheres to modern event-driven
execution principles.
In this project, a Smart Conveyor Sorting System will be first developed using IEC 61131-based ECE. Then,
an AI-powered function block conversion system will be implemented to translate the ECE logic into IEC
61499-based EAE. This tool will ensure an efficient, error-free migration, maintaining the original sorting logic
while benefiting from the distributed execution model of EAE.
