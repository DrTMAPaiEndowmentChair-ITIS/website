## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing and implementing an AI-powered system that leverages advanced AI tools such as Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to enable users to query specific data from documents via an LLM chatbot.

LLMs are advanced AI models capable of understanding and generating human language, making them ideal for interpreting and responding to user queries. VLMs extend this capability by integrating visual data, allowing for more comprehensive document analysis. OCR technology converts different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDF files, or images captured by a digital camera, into editable and searchable data.

The integration of these technologies allows for the creation of a sophisticated system that can accurately extract and present information from various document formats. This project aims to develop a tool that automates the querying process, ensuring that users can easily retrieve specific data from documents with high accuracy and efficiency.

By leveraging LLMs, VLMs, and OCR, this system will enable users to interact with documents in a natural and intuitive manner, significantly enhancing document management and information retrieval capabilities.
